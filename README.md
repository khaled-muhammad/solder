# Two Bulb Blinker PCB â€” First Ever Soldered Project

## Project Description
This is my **first PCB project ever!** I built a simple **two-bulb blinker** with a small delay, using **only transistors and capacitors â€” no microcontrollers!**  

The LEDs blink **alternately with a delay**, controlled purely by electronic components.
